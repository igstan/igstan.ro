title: Git's environment filter

This is a thing I keep on forgetting although I've done it several times. So, I'm
writing a blog post hoping it will help me memorize this.

So... how do you rewrite Git's history, specifically the environment variables.
With `git filter-branch` of course. I frequently need it in order to change the
author and committer email addresses (either from personal to work or the other
way around).

~~~bash
git filter-branch --env-filter 'export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="email@address.com"' HEAD
git filter-branch --env-filter 'export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="email@address.com"' HEAD
~~~

Don't forget that there are two email addresses, OK? The author's and committer's
one. Oh, and no spaces around the equal sign.

For a more complicated situation see [this answer on serverfault.com][1].
