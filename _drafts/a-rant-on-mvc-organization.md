title: A Rant on MVC Project Organization

Imagine going to a store looking for cheese. The store is big and you're in a hurry, so you ask one of the employees where the cheese isle is located. They tell you that there's not a specific cheese isle. Instead, their store's merchandise is organized by packaging type. This is the isle with plastic-wrapped products, this is the isle with products packaged in glass, these are in paper, and so on. There's no further level of organization below this level.

This is exactly what most MVC project structures look like.

```
- project
  - models
  - views
  - controllers
```

What kind of products does this store sell? We don't know. All we know is the type of packaging they use. So, if you're lucky, you might find cheese.
