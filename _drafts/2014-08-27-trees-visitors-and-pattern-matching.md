- show tree encodings in a language that supports ADTs
- show how to perform calculations on it using pattern matching
- provide an alternative using Church encoding, i.e., `fold`
- show tree encodings in a OO language, like Java
- show how to perform calculations on it using visitors
- relate visitors to pattern matching and church encoding
- bonus: show how multiple layers in a tree can be computed using visitors (augmented local visitors)
