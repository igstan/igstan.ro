Alan Kay is most famous to programmers for his ground breaking innovations
in the area of object-oriented programming. But he was not just a computer
scientist, he also had a background in biology. Apparently that's the field
where he took some inspiration from when comping up with the concepts behind
objects. I must highlight though, what

However, Alan Kay is also credited for having said the following at some point:

> Quote saying his view of OO was different than what it stands today.

The field he took inspiration from was biology. Here's what he said:

> I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual
> computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages (so
> messaging came at the very beginning

Right now I'm reading this article[2] and can't stop wondering myself whether we
can't take Alan Kay's idea of OO one step further. How could we implement
feedback loops that could evolve our systems? And what would be the substrate
for this evolution.

This seems to be a good introductory [book][3].

I have to study more about this before publishing anything.

Erlang seems to have some feedback loop between its actors also. Need to study
that more too.
