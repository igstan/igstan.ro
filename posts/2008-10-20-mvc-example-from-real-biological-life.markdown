Lately I've been thinking a lot about software design patterns and software
architecture in an attempt of being a better software developer (or just being
one). Anyway, too much talk, I want to get to the subject because I think it's
very nice.

You've probably heard of the [Model-View-Controller pattern][1] which is a big
hype nowadays thanks to the Ruby on Rails web framework. It's all about separating
data access (Model) from data presentation (View) and that's all. You may wonder
where's the third part, the Controller. It's in between gluing the two parts
together. The controller, while an important aspect of the <abbr title="Model-View-Controller">MVC</abbr>
paradigm, is not as important as the idea of separation data and presentation.

You've also probably read a lot of examples about MVC, involving web application
that suddenly have to switch from a certain database vendor to another or output
data in multiple formats, like <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
<abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>,
<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, <abbr title="Et cetera">etc.</abbr>
Well, here's a little <abbr title="Model-View-Controller">MVC</abbr> example that
actually lies within your own body.

It's the very human act of expressing ideas, either written or spoken.

When someone is expressing her ideas in speech she uses an <abbr title="Model-View-Controller">MVC</abbr>
system where data is the idea itself (what she thinks) that sits in the Model
(our conscience and perception of the surrounding world), the View is the language
in which the ideas are presented and the Controller is the sum of biological and
associated neuronic structures that let us map these ideas to comprehensible and
logical sounds (in a normal human being).

It's true that I exaggerated a little about the limits between the parts of this
system and that these are very blurry line that separate them... nevertheless is
the idea that matters. If it weren't for this <abbr title="Model-View-Controller">MVC</abbr>
system inside us, speaking foreign languages would be impossible.

<abbr title="Post, Post Scriptum">P.S.S.</abbr> I'm not implying that my English view is perfect
