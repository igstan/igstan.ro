title: Komodo Edit dark theme

For some time now, I developed some computer related eye fatigue, which kinda
sucks and I believe this is due (in part) to the white background of my text
  editor(s). That's why I decided to try a dark theme in Komodo Edit. The one
shipped with the editor is a bit ugly, I wanted something more like [Twilight
for Textmate][1] and any Google search for Komodo themes returned pretty much
nothing. So, here's my creation, inspired by all those dark themes out there,
especially Twilight.

<p style="text-align: center;">

         alt="Screenshot for PHP syntax">
  </a>
</p>

If you like it, you can grab the [theme file][2] from my [GitHub repo][3].

It only supports PHP and JavaScript syntax for the moment. More to come when I'll
have some time. Update: There's Python and XML support right now.

After you download it, put the ".ksf" file in your Komodo Edit application data
folder, more precisely the schemes directory. On my Windows machine this is:
`C:\Documents and Settings\{user}\Application Data\ActiveState\KomodoEdit\4.3\schemes`.

Enjoy!
